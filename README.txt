Welcome to my programming project 2!

To run this program, first enter "make" into your console and then enter "./rbtree filename" where filename is the name of the input file containing the information for the tree. The file should be formatted as described in the spec. The list of nodes should not contain any spaces, only the numbers and letters separated by commas. There should be an empty line between the tree and the "search threads" line. There should also be an empty line between the "modify threads" and the commands. The commands can span over many lines.
The commands must be separated by " || ".

The output will be printed to a file called "out.txt" in the project folder. The output contains the execution time, result of each function call and which thread performed it, and the final state of the red black tree.

Thank you!
